# OpenLayers_2.13.1 - Modified Google Map Layers Blank Issue
This project is a modified version of OpenLayers 2.13.1, a popular open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. The modifications have been made to address issues related to displaying Google Maps layers, which have been causing blank maps to appear due to changes in the Google Maps API.

As OpenLayers 2.13.1 is an older version of the library, it is no longer supported and cannot be used for new map development. This modified version aims to provide a solution for those still using OpenLayers 2.13.1 and experiencing issues with Google Maps layers.

The modifications may include changes to the codebase to integrate a different API for displaying Google Maps layers, or updates to the existing API to ensure compatibility with the latest Google Maps requirements. This project aims to provide a reliable and up-to-date solution for displaying Google Maps layers within the OpenLayers 2.13.1 framework.
